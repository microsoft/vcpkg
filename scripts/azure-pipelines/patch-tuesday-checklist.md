## First time machine setup:
* [ ] Install Azure PowerShell: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps

## Each Patch Tuesday:

      "C++ VCPKG Validation" about vulnerable software we are installing in the VMs and update that.
      (Most often PowerShell needs to be updated)
* [ ] Check for any other software for the Windows images we wish to update and make the edits to do
      so in `scripts/azure-pipelines/windows`
* [ ] Check for any updates possible to `vcpkgTools.xml`. Note that PowerShell currently uses the
    7.2.x series due to customer reported problems on older Windows with 7.3.x and later.
