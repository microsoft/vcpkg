pybind11 provides CMake targets. There are two modes provided; classic, which is built on the old Python
discovery packages in CMake, or the new FindPython mode, which uses FindPython
from 3.12+ forward (3.15+ _highly_ recommended).

New FindPython mode:

    find_package(Python COMPONENTS Interpreter Development)
    find_package(pybind11 CONFIG)

    # pybind11 method:
    pybind11_add_module(MyModule1 src1.cpp)

    # Python method:
    Python_add_library(MyModule2 src2.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(MyModule2 pybind11::headers)
    set_target_properties(MyModule2 PROPERTIES
        INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION ON
        CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET ON
        VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN ON
    )
