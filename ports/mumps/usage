The package mumps provides CMake targets:

  pkg_check_modules(coinmumps REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET coinmumps)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE PkgConfig::coinmumps)

COINMUMPS is a Coin-Or autotools harness to build MUMPS (MUltifrontal
Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver) for solving systems of linear
equations of the form Ax = b where A is a square sparse matrix.

The coinmumps target provides access to the Coin-Or build of mumps-solver
with all required dependencies (BLAS, LAPACK (both provided by OpenBLAS), METIS, and optionally MPI)
automatically linked.

This version uses the Coin-Or ThirdParty-Mumps build system which provides
better integration with other COIN-OR solvers and includes additional
compatibility patches.
