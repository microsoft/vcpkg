The package jrl-cmakemodules provides a collection of CMake macros
used to manage projects in the jrl-umi3218 ecosystem.

It is primarily intended for internal use by libraries such as
coal and pinocchio.

This package relies on several non-standard and non-modern CMake
patterns. As a result, it is generally **not recommended** to use
jrl-cmakemodules directly in new projects unless you know exactly
what you are doing.

Due to these design choices, jrl-cmakemodules **must be located and
initialized before the main `project()` call** when used with vcpkg.
In particular, it is strongly recommended to define the environment
variable

    ENV{jrl-cmakemodules_ROOT}

ahead of time, so that `find_package(jrl-cmakemodules CONFIG REQUIRED)`
can succeed before `project()` is invoked.

A minimal working example is shown below.

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

    # 1. MANDATORY: Define metadata required by jrl-cmakemodules
    set(PROJECT_NAME MyProject)
    set(PROJECT_DESCRIPTION "Description of the project")
    set(PROJECT_URL "https://github.com/user/project")

    # 2. Find the jrl-cmakemodules
    find_package(jrl-cmakemodules CONFIG REQUIRED)

    # 3. Include the base infrastructure
    include(${jrl-cmakemodules_DIR}/base.cmake)

    # 4. Setup project arguments (Version, Policies, etc.)
    compute_project_args(PROJECT_ARGS LANGUAGES CXX)
    project(${PROJECT_NAME} ${PROJECT_ARGS})

    # 5. (Optional) Link to the target if you need its include directories
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE jrl-cmakemodules::jrl-cmakemodules)
