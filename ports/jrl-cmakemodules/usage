The package jrl-cmakemodules provides CMake macros to manage projects.
To use it correctly with vcpkg, you MUST find it before the main project() call:

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

    # 1. Bootstrapping: Trigger vcpkg to set paths without detecting compilers yet
    project(MyProject_vcpkg_helper LANGUAGES NONE)

    # 2. Find the modules
    find_package(jrl-cmakemodules CONFIG REQUIRED)

    # 3. MANDATORY: Define metadata required by jrl-cmakemodules
    set(PROJECT_NAME MyProject)
    set(PROJECT_DESCRIPTION "Description of my project")
    set(PROJECT_URL "https://github.com/user/project")

    # 4. Include the base infrastructure
    include(${jrl-cmakemodules_DIR}/base.cmake)

    # 5. Setup project arguments (Version, Policies, etc.)
    COMPUTE_PROJECT_ARGS(PROJECT_ARGS LANGUAGES CXX)
    project(MyProject ${PROJECT_ARGS})

    # 6. (Optional) Link to the target if you need its include directories
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE jrl-cmakemodules::jrl-cmakemodules)
