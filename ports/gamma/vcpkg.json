  "description": "Gamma is a cross-platform, C++ library for doing generic synthesis and filtering of signals. It is oriented towards real-time sound and graphics applications, but is equally useful for non-real-time tasks. Gamma is designed to be \"light-footed\" in terms of memory and processing making it highly suitable for plug-in development or embedding in other C++ projects.",
