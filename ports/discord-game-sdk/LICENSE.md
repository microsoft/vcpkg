# Discord Developer Terms of Service

## Effective Date: August 20, 2017

This Discord Developer Terms of Service (“Agreement”) is between Discord Inc. (“Discord” or
“us”) and you (“you” or “Licensee”).

Discord has developed an Application Programming Interface (“API”) and Software
Development Kit (“SDK”) in connection with our Discord online and mobile chat platform (the
“Platform”). By using the API, SDK and/or its accompanying instructions, manuals, guidelines,
samples and examples (the “Documentation”), you agree to be bound by this Agreement. End
users using the Platform in connection with Licensee’s Applications (“End Users”) must be
bound by the Discord Terms of Service, currently located at [https://discordapp.com/terms](https://discordapp.com/terms) (the
“TOS”). Please note that the TOS includes Discord’s Privacy Policy, currently located at
[https://discordapp.com/privacy](https://discordapp.com/privacy) (“Privacy Policy”).

**By downloading, accessing or using the API or SDK or Documentation in any way,
Licensee affirms that Licensee has read this Agreement, understands it, and agrees to be
bound by it.**

### 1\. API AND SDK

1.1 **API and SDK.** The API and SDK consists of specific programmatic application
programming interfaces, interface definitions, generated code libraries and associated tools. The
API is an interface that facilitates interaction with the Platform’s servers. The SDK is software
code that is designed to be integrated into and to ship bundle with your applications
(“Applications”).

1.2 **API or SDK Modifications.** Discord reserves the right to modify the API or SDK, and to
release subsequent versions. You may be required to use the most recent version of the API or
SDK in order to obtain certain functionality.

1.3 **Support.** Discord has no obligation to provide you or any users of your Applications with
support, software upgrades, enhancements or modifications to the API or SDK. If Discord makes
available updated versions of the API or SDK, you will use reasonable efforts to use only the
then-current version as soon as possible and will use only the then-current version within 30 days
of the date the then-current version becomes available. You understand and agree that you are
solely responsible for providing user support and any other technical assistance for your
Applications and other products and/or services.

### 2\. LICENSE, ACCOUNTS AND RESTRICTIONS

2.1 **API or SDK License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Discord grants
you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to access and use the API or
SDK solely to as necessary to (i) develop, test, display and execute your Applications with the
API or SDK functionality included; and (ii) distribute to third parties, or permit third parties to
access, the API or SDK as integrated into your Applications.

2.2 **Restrictions.** You shall not, and shall not permit any person, directly or indirectly, to (i)
reverse engineer, disassemble, reconstruct, decompile, translate, modify or copy the API or SDK,
other than as explicitly permitted hereunder (except to the extent the foregoing restriction is
expressly prohibited by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation), (ii) create derivative
works of the API or SDK or any aspect or portion thereof, including without limitation, source
code and algorithms, (iii) distribute or otherwise disseminate the API or SDK by any means or in
any form, except as an integral part of your Applications; (iv) use the API or SDK in connection
with any Applications that include any malware or other harmful code or that facilitate
spamming in any way; (v) circumvent any limits or any privacy or access controls (or attempt to
do so); or (vi) include any advertisements or other promotions within the functionality enabled
by the API or SDK. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Discord reserves all rights
in or the API and SDK.

2.3 **Trademark License and Branding.** Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Discord grants you
a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to display the Discord trademark
solely for the purpose of attributing the source of the API or SDK and indicating that you used
the API or SDK in creating your Applications. In doing so, you shall adhere to Discord’s brand
guidelines, currently located at [https://discordapp.com/branding](https://discordapp.com/branding). In addition, all use of the SDK
must be in compliance with Discord’s in-game brand guidelines. All use by you of the Discord
trademark (including any goodwill associated therewith) shall inure to the benefit of Discord. At
no time during or after the term of this Agreement shall you challenge or assist others to
challenge the Discord trademark or the registration thereof by Discord, nor shall you attempt to
register the Discord trademark or brand identifiers (including domain names) that are
confusingly similar in any way (including but not limited to, sound, appearance and spelling) to
the Discord trademark. You shall include in your Applications, website and other relevant
locations a disclaimer stating that your Applications, website or any services is or are not
endorsed or created by Discord.

2.4 **End User Data.** “End User Data” means all data associated with the content within the
functionality enabled by the API or SDK, including but not limited to message content, message metadata,
voice data and voice metadata. You acknowledge and agree that Discord and its end users, as applicable,
retain all worldwide right, title and interest in and to the End User Data. If you have access to
End User Data through the API or the SDK, you shall ensure that your Applications do not collect,
use and/or disclose End User Data except (a) as necessary to exercise your rights under this Agreement,
(b) in accordance with Discord’s Privacy Policy. If you have access to End User Data through the SDK,
you additionally agree to get express permission from the End Users.

You shall not sell, license or otherwise commercialize any End User Data. You may not use End User Data
to target End Users for marketing or advertising purposes. You may not disclose End User Data to
any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization related service.

You shall delete all End User Data upon Discord’s or the End User’s request and within seven (7) days
following the End User’s termination of the End User’s account. You may only retain chat logs as
necessary for the operation of your Applications. Discord’s offering of an API or SDK that allows
you to reproduce or display End User message content is not an express or implied license to such
content from Discord.

2.5 **End Users.** Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, you agree to the
following with respect to End Users and their accounts:

(a) You shall not modify an End User's account state except in response to such End User
giving you explicit permission to do so. For example, you may not join an End User to a
server unless such End User approved joining that server (such as when using a "group
finder" app).

(b) You shall not post messages, trigger notifications, or play audio on behalf of an End
User except in response to such End User expressly opting-in to each instance of such
behavior.

(c) You shall ensure that your Application retains End User Data after the End User’s termination
of the End User’s account only if the End User associated with such End User Data expressly triggers
a command with an explicit keyword or click (on a website) and even in such cases, such End User Data
shall be retained only as necessary to provide the defined functionality of the Application.

(d) You shall ensure that an End User’s access to the Platform or any portion of
functionality enabled by the SDK or API is subject to the TOS; accordingly, you shall
ensure that all End Users expressly agree to the TOS. Without limiting the foregoing,
you shall ensure that each End User expressly agree to the collection, use and disclosure
of all information made available by such End User in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the TOS, which includes Discord’s Privacy Policy.

(e) You and your Application will not, and you will not, encourage or create functionality
for your users that violates Discord’s TOS.

(f) You shall ensure that all End User Data is stored using reasonable security measures, including,
but not limited to encryption, and that you take reasonable steps to secure End User Data.

(g) You shall not obtain End User passwords to Discord’s service under any
circumstance; you shall use only Discord’s designated approval methods for obtaining
access to or permission to access End User Data.

2.6 **Developer Accounts.** You will need to create an account to have access to the SDK and/or
API (the “Developer Account”). In conjunction with your Developer Account, you will: (a)
provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself, your Applications and
your business (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly
update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You may be limited
by the account creation process to one account per email address. You are entirely responsible
for the security and confidentiality of your password and Developer Account. Furthermore, you
are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You will not
share your Developer Account, your user name and password with any third party or permit any
third party to log on using your account information. You agree to immediately notify us of any
unauthorized use of your Developer Account or any other breach of security of which you
become aware. You agree that we can use, store, and share Registration Data as permitted in
Discord’s Privacy Policy. Discord maintains the right to cancel your Developer Account for any
reason or no reason at all, at any time. After you have successfully created your Developer
Account, you will be issued one or more unique security keys, secrets, tokens, access codes,
passwords or other credentials (collectively, “Keys”). All activities that occur using your Keys
are your responsibility. You are not permitted to disclose, sell, transfer, or sublicense them to
anyone.

2.7 **Rate Limits.** You will not attempt to exceed or circumvent limitations on access to and use of
the SDK or API, exceed or circumvent any limitation on the API calls you may make, or
otherwise use the SDK or API in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume, or
constitutes excessive or abusive usage (“Rate Limits”). If Discord, in its sole discretion,
determines that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent Rate Limits, or other controls that
limit use of the SDK or API, then your ability to use the SDK or API may be temporarily
suspended or permanently blocked.

2.8 **Security Measures.** Your network, operating system and the software of your web servers,
databases, and computer systems must be properly configured to securely operate and store your
Applications. Your Applications must use industry standard security measures to protect against
and prevent security breaches and any unauthorized disclosure of the personal information of
your End Users, including administrative, physical and technical safeguards for protection of the
security, confidentiality and integrity of the personal information of your End Users. You must
promptly report any security deficiencies in, or intrusions to, your Applications or systems that
you discover.

2.9 **Audit and Monitoring.** You agree to provide us with access to your
Applications and/or other materials related to your use of the API and SDK as may be requested
by us to verify your compliance with this Agreement, to audit your use, display and storage of
the API and SDK. You agree that we may crawl or otherwise remotely monitor such items
related to your use of the API and SDK and you agree not to block or interfere with such efforts.

### 3\. WARRANTY

You represent and warrant to Discord that: (a) you have validly entered
into this Agreement and have the legal power to do so; (b) you are responsible for the conduct of
your End Users and their compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the TOS; (c) any
Applications developed by you or your contractors shall not infringe or violate the intellectual
property, proprietary, privacy or other rights of any person or entity; (d) you shall comply with
all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to privacy laws and regulations; (e)
your Applications must use industry standard security measures to protect against and prevent
security breaches of your Applications and unauthorized access to your End User’s personal
information; and (f) you have and comply with a privacy policy that complies with all applicable
laws.

### 4\. DISCORD APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND FEEDBACK

You acknowledge
and agree that Discord may create features, applications, content, and other products or services
that may be similar to your Applications, and nothing in this Agreement will be construed as
restricting or preventing Discord from creating and fully exploiting such applications, content
and other items, without any obligation to you. If you elect to provide us with any suggestions or
feedback, you hereby assign all right, title and interest in and to such suggestions or feedback to
Discord and acknowledge that we will be entitled to use, implement and exploit any such
suggestions or feedback in any manner without restriction, and without any obligation of
confidentiality, attribution, accounting or compensation to you.

### 5\. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

Except for the licenses expressly granted to you in this
Agreement, Discord shall own and retain all right, title and interest, including without limitation
all intellectual property rights, in and to (i) the API or SDK and any and all elements and
components thereof, including content, technology, software code, user interfaces and any
derivative works and/or compilations thereof; (ii) the Discord trademark; and (iii) any feedback
provided by you (including suggestions, comments, improvements, ideas, etc.) about or relating
to Discord, the API or SDK or any applications, websites or other materials that Discord may be
developing (collectively, “Discord Property”). You shall own and retain all right, title and
interest in and to your Applications, except with respect to any Discord Property or End User
Data that has been incorporated therein.

### 6\. TERMINATION

Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that we may have,
Discord may terminate the license granted hereunder: (i) upon notice if Licensee fails to comply
with any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; or (ii) for convenience, upon thirty (30)
days’ prior written notice. In addition, Discord may terminate or suspend the license granted
hereunder if your Application(s) for any reason compromise or threaten to compromise the
integrity of Discord’s service. In the event the license is terminated, Licensee shall discontinue
any further use, and destroy all copies, of the API or SDK and Documentation in its possession
or control. Sections 1.2, 1.3, 4-9 and 11-16 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

### 7\. NO WARRANTY

THE API OR SDK AND DOCUMENTATION ARE BEING
PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 8\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL DISCORD OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(COLLECTIVELY, THE "DISCORD PARTIES") BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR
DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF INFORMATION
OR DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE API OR SDK
OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY EVENT, THE DISCORD PARTIES’
TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AND
TYPE (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT OR TORT) SHALL NOT
EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE LICENSE FEE (IF ANY) PAID BY YOU FOR THE
API OR SDK OR (B) \$100. THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS
AGREEMENT DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER RIGHTS THAT
CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
which means that some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you. IN
THESE JURISDICTIONS, DISCORD’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE
GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
IT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT IN THE EVENT ANY REMEDY
HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL
LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN
SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT.

### 9\. INDEMNIFICATION

Licensee, at its own expense, shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Discord and its affiliates, and its and their employees, contractors, agents, directors and
customers from and against any and all claims, actions, demands, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, settlements, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (any or all of
the foregoing hereinafter referred to as “Losses”), insofar as such Losses (or third party actions
in respect thereof) are based on, arise out of, or are related to (i) a breach by Licensee of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it hereunder or (ii) the use, operation,
promotion, distribution or license of the Applications by Licensee or its employees, contractors
or agents.

### 10\. CONFIDENTIALITY

You will: (a) protect and not disclose information made available
by us that is identified as confidential or that reasonably should be considered confidential; (b)
use this information only to fulfill your obligations under this Agreement; and (c) either destroy
or return all such information to us promptly when the Agreement terminates (and, upon request,
confirm such destruction in writing).

### 11\. PUBLICITY

Licensee grants us the right to use Licensee’s company name and logo for
marketing or promotional purposes on our website if Licensee’s use of the SDK or API is public.
Otherwise, Discord will obtain Licensee’s prior written permission for such use.

### 12\. EXPORT CONTROLS

In connection with Licensee’s use of the API or SDK Licensee
shall comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations such as the
Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and countryspecific
economic sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

### 13\. CHILDREN

The Platform is not intended for and should not be used by anyone under
the age of 13. Licensee will not knowingly collect or enable the collection of any personal
information from children under the age of 13.

### 14\. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Licensee agrees that Discord will have the right to seek an

unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such provision shall be adjusted to the
minimum extent necessary for validity or enforceability, and in any event, the remaining
provisions will nevertheless remain in full force and effect.

### 16\. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and
agreement between Discord and you with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications with respect thereto.
We may change this Agreement from time to time in our discretion. If we make a material
change to the Agreement, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the change taking
effect. Licensee can review the most current version of the Agreement at any time by visiting
this page. The materially revised Agreement will become effective on the date set forth in our
notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting of the change. If Licensee (or
your End Users) accesses or uses the Platform after the effective date, that use will constitute
your acceptance of any revised terms and conditions.

### 17\. GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

This Agreement shall be
interpreted, construed and enforced in all respects in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law. Any claim or dispute
between you and the Company that arises in whole or in part from this Agreement or your use of
the API or SDK shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in
Santa Clara County, California, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of
personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state
and federal courts of Santa Clara County, California.

### 18\. NO ASSIGNMENT

Licensee shall not assign, sublicense or delegate any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of Discord.
Any assignment, sublicense or delegation in violation of this provision shall be null and void.

### 19\. GOVERNMENT USE AND ACCESS

The API and SDK are “commercial items” as
that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and
“commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212.
Any use, modification, derivative, reproduction, release, performance, display, disclosure or
distribution of the API or SDK by any government entity is prohibited, except as expressly
permitted by the terms of this Agreement. Additionally, any use by U.S. government entities
must be in accordance with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4. The
contractor/manufacturer is Discord Inc., 401 California Ave Burlingame, CA 94010. Licensee
shall not allow or assist any government entities, law enforcement, or other organizations to
conduct surveillance or obtain data using its access to the SDK or API in order to avoid serving
legal process directly on Discord. Any such use by you for law enforcement purposes is a breach
of this Agreement.

### 20\. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Use of the API or SDK affirms that Licensee has read this
Agreement, understands it, and agrees to be bound by its contents.
