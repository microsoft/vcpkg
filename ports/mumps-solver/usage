The package mumps provides CMake targets:

	find_package(MUMPS CONFIG REQUIRED)

mumps-solver uses a scivision cmake harness to build MUMPS (MUltifrontal
Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver) for solving systems of linear
equations of the form Ax = b where A is a square sparse matrix.

The MUMPS target provides access to the Coin-Or build of mumps-solver
with all required dependencies (BLAS, LAPACK, METIS).
