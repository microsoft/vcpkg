  "description": "CLN is a library for computations with all kinds of numbers. It has a rich set of number classes, including integers (with unlimited precision), reals with various precisions (including unlimited), rationals, complex numbers and polynomials. The kernel is written in assembly language. It uses garbage collection (automatic, without imposing any burden on the main application). Many efficient algorithms (i.e. for all transcendental functions) are implemented.",
