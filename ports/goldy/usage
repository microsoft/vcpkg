The package goldy provides CMake targets:

    find_package(goldy CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE goldy::goldy)

Include the headers:
    #include <goldy.hpp>  // C++ RAII wrapper
    #include <goldy.h>    // C API

Note: goldy_ffi.dll must be in your PATH or next to your executable at runtime.
The Slang compiler (slang.dll) is also required at runtime (from Vulkan SDK).
