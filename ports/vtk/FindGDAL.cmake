# FindGDAL
# --------
#
#
#
# Locate gdal
#
# This module accepts the following environment variables:
#
# ::
#
#     GDAL_DIR or GDAL_ROOT - Specify the location of GDAL
#
#
#
# This module defines the following CMake variables:
#
# ::
#
#     GDAL_FOUND - True if libgdal is found
#     GDAL_LIBRARY - A variable pointing to the GDAL library
#     GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR - Where to find the headers

#
# $GDALDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$GDAL_DIR
# used in building gdal.
#
# Created by Eric Wing. I'm not a gdal user, but OpenSceneGraph uses it
# for osgTerrain so I whipped this module together for completeness.
# I actually don't know the conventions or where files are typically
# placed in distros.
# Any real gdal users are encouraged to correct this (but please don't
# break the OS X framework stuff when doing so which is what usually seems
# to happen).

# This makes the presumption that you are include gdal.h like
#
#include "gdal.h"
