This package is only an OpenCL SDK. To actually run OpenCL code you also need to install an implementation.

  Windows: Implementations typically ship with the drivers of you CPU/GPU vendors.
  Linux:   Implementations may be installed from your distro's repo or manually.
  Apple:   Consult your distribution vendor on the state of OpenCL support:
