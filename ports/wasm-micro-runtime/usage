The package wasm-micro-runtime provides CMake targets:

    find_package(iwasm CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE iwasm)

The package wasm-micro-runtime also exports the library target `vmlib` which can be used directly:

    find_package(iwasm CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE vmlib)

Note: The default features include AOT compiler, classic interpreter, fast interpreter, 
libc builtin, libc WASI, and reference types support. These match the default configuration 
of WAMR.

On Windows, hardware bound checking is disabled to avoid additional dependencies.
