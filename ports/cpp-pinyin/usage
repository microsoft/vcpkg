cpp-pinyin provides CMake targets:

    find_package(cpp-pinyin CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE cpp-pinyin::cpp-pinyin)

    To use the library, you need to copy the dictionary files to the binary directory.

    add_custom_command(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} POST_BUILD
        COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory
        ${_VCPKG_INSTALLED_DIR}/${VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET}/share/cpp-pinyin/dict
        $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:${PROJECT_NAME}>/dict
    )

    To generate your own dictionary files, you can use the pinyin-makedict tool provided by cpp-pinyin.
