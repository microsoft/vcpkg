The legacy DirectX SDK D3DX package provides CMake targets:

    find_package(dxsdk-d3dx CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE Microsoft::D3DX9 Microsoft::D3DX10 Microsoft::D3DX11)

NOTE: This port is not recommended for use in new projects and is incompatible with the deprecated directxsdk port.
