The package libpg-query provides C headers and a library for the PostgreSQL parser.

Example CMake usage:

  find_package(unofficial-libpg-query CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE unofficial::libpg-query::libpg-query)

If you use the protobuf APIs (pg_query_parse_protobuf, pg_query_scan, etc.),
also add the protobuf-c headers to your include path, for example by adding
"protobuf-c" to your vcpkg.json dependencies.
