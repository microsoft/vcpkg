modern-c-web-library provides the following libraries:

    weblib (static library)
    weblib_shared (shared library)

To use in your CMakeLists.txt:

    # Find the library (installed by vcpkg)
    find_library(WEBLIB_LIBRARY NAMES weblib)
    find_path(WEBLIB_INCLUDE_DIR weblib.h)
    
    # Link to your target
    target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${WEBLIB_INCLUDE_DIR})
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${WEBLIB_LIBRARY})

On Unix platforms (Linux, macOS), also link pthread:

    if(UNIX)
        target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE pthread)
    endif()
