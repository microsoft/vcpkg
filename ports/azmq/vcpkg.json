    "Boost Asio style bindings for ZeroMQ",
    "This library is built on top of ZeroMQ's standard C interface and is intended to work well with C++ applications which use the Boost libraries in general, and Asio in particular.",
    "The main abstraction exposed by the library is azmq::socket which provides an Asio style socket interface to the underlying zeromq socket and interfaces with Asio's io_service(). The socket implementation participates in the io_service's reactor for asynchronous IO and may be freely mixed with other Asio socket types (raw TCP/UDP/Serial/etc.)."
