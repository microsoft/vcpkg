The package pdal provides CMake variables:

    find_package(PDAL CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_include_directories(${PDAL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${PDAL_LIBRARIES})
        
If necessary, override the default plugin search path by setting the
environment variable PDAL_DRIVER_PATH to a list of directories that
pdal should search for plugins.
