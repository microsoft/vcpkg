pdal provides CMake targets:

  find_package(PDAL CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE $<TARGET_NAME:pdalcpp>)
        
If necessary, override the default plugin search path by setting the
environment variable PDAL_DRIVER_PATH to a list of directories that
PDAL should search for plugins.
