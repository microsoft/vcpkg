The DirectXTex package provides CMake targets:

    find_package(directxtex CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE Microsoft::DirectXTex)

For the 'xbox' feature, it defaults to targeting Xbox Series X|S. To set it to Xbox One,
create a custom triplet from x64-windows with the addition of the following:

    if (PORT STREQUAL "directxtex")
        set(DIRECTXTEX_XBOX_CONSOLE_TARGET "xboxone")
    endif()
