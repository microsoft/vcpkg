vlc-binary is provided as an unofficial CMake package:

  find_package(unofficial-vlc CONFIG REQUIRED)

This port is runtime-only. It does not provide headers or import libraries for linking.

This port installs the VLC runtime distribution under:
  <vcpkg>/installed/<triplet>/share/vlc-binary/vlc

The CMake package exposes:
- unofficial_vlc_runtime_dir
- unofficial_vlc_plugins_dir

At runtime, deploy the VLC folder (keep plugins/ relative to libvlc.dll):
- Copy the contents of:
    <vcpkg>/installed/<triplet>/share/vlc-binary/vlc
  into a folder shipped with your application.

If you do not keep plugins/ next to libvlc.dll, set:
- VLC_PLUGIN_PATH to:
    <that folder>/plugins
