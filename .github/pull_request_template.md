<!-- If this PR adds a new port, please uncomment and fill out this checklist:

- [ ] Changes comply with the [maintainer guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-docs/blob/main/vcpkg/contributing/maintainer-guide.md).
- [ ] The name of the port matches an existing name for this component on https://repology.org/ if possible, and/or is strongly associated with that component on search engines.
- [ ] Optional dependencies are resolved in exactly one way. For example, if the component is built with CMake, all `find_package` calls are REQUIRED, are satisfied by `vcpkg.json`'s declared dependencies, or disabled with [CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Xxx](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_PackageName.html).
- [ ] The versioning scheme in `vcpkg.json` matches what upstream says.
- [ ] The license declaration in `vcpkg.json` matches what upstream says.
- [ ] The installed as the "copyright" file matches what upstream says.
- [ ] The source code of the component installed comes from an authoritative source.
- [ ] The generated "usage text" is accurate. See [adding-usage](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-docs/blob/main/vcpkg/examples/adding-usage.md) for context.
- [ ] The version database is fixed by rerunning `./vcpkg x-add-version --all` and committing the result.
- [ ] Only one version is in the new port's versions file.
- [ ] Only one version is added to each modified port's versions file.
